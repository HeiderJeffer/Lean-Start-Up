-PinPoint
Every minute counts in case of emergency. To provide more precise information and shorten the intervention time of emergency services is our main goal.
 A tracking carabiner designed for adventure lovers.\nPinpoint device is a GPS real time tracker which transmits your position in case of emergency to the person you trust in, even in dead zones. It is fashionable and easy to use. You simply attach it to your belt and forget about it: if you have an accident just click on the SOS button and a notification of your exact position will be immediately sent to the person you appointed to call the emergency service for you. Furthermore, Pinpoint has sensors to detect automatically if something happens to you and youâ€™re not able to click the button.
